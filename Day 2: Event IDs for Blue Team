## 🔎 Detection Use Cases

### ✅ Brute Force Login Detection
- Multiple `4625` (failed login) events in a short time

### ✅ Privilege Escalation Monitoring
- A `4624` login followed by a `4672` event indicates privilege escalation

### ✅ Malware Execution Traces
- `4688` shows processes like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, or `mshta.exe`

### ✅ Covering Tracks
- `1102` indicates someone cleared the Security log

## 🧪 Practical Task

1. 🔐 Simulate wrong password attempts on your own PC
   - Lock your screen → Enter wrong password 2–3 times → Enter correct one

2. 📖 Open Event Viewer
   - Go to **Windows Logs → Security**
   - Use **Filter Current Log** to search Event IDs `4624`, `4625`, `4672`

3. 🕵️‍♂️ Analyze each log:
   - Account Name
   - Logon Type (2 = interactive, 3 = network)
   - Source IP
   - Timestamp

4. ✅ If you installed **Sysmon** on Day 1:
   - Go to: **Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon**
   - Look for **Event ID 1** (Process Creation)
