# 🛡️ Blue Team Learning - Day 3: Installing & Using Sysmon (Simple & Clear)

## 📅 Date: June 26, 2025  
## 🎯 Goal:
Set up **Sysmon** to collect detailed logs from Windows. These logs help us detect suspicious activity like malware, hacking attempts, or system misuse.

## 🧠 What is Sysmon?

**Sysmon (System Monitor)** is a free tool by Microsoft that watches your system and writes important security events to logs.

Unlike normal Windows logs, **Sysmon gives more detail**:
- Which programs start (and who started them)
- If a suspicious connection happens
- What files or registry settings are changed

👉 Think of it like giving Windows **X-ray vision** for defenders.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: How to Install Sysmon

### ✅ Step 1: Download Sysmon
📥 [Sysmon Official Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

### ✅ Step 2: Download a Good Config File
A **Sysmon config** tells it **what to log** and **what to ignore**.

Use this trusted config:
