# 🛡️ Blue Team Learning - Day 4 (Linux): Log Monitoring with Auditd

## 📅 Date: June 27, 2025  
## 🎯 Goal:
Learn how to monitor system activity on Linux using built-in log files and the `auditd` audit framework to detect unauthorized actions like suspicious command usage or access to critical files.

## 📁 Linux Log Basics

Linux stores logs under `/var/log`. Some important files:

| Log File       | What It Tracks                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/var/log/auth.log` | Login attempts, SSH, sudo usage         |
| `/var/log/syslog`   | System messages, services                |
| `/var/log/dmesg`    | Boot & hardware-related messages         |
| `/var/log/fail2ban.log` | Banned IPs, brute-force attempts     |

## 🧰 Step-by-Step: Monitor Logs with Auditd

### ✅ Step 1: Install Auditd

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install auditd -y

sudo systemctl status auditd


Step 2: Add Monitoring Rules
🔹 Track execution of bash shell:

sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F path=/bin/bash -F perm=x -k bash_exec
🔹 Watch for access to /etc/passwd:

sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p rwxa -k passwd_watch


: Simulate Activity
🔸 Run Bash:

/bin/bash
exit
🔸 Access a sensitive file:

sudo cat /etc/passwd
✅ Step 4: View Logs
🔍 Search for bash execution:

sudo ausearch -k bash_exec
🔍 Search for file access:

sudo ausearch -k passwd_watch
📚 Bonus: Use journalctl for system log search
View system log entries:

journalctl -xe
View only sudo actions:


journalctl _COMM=sudo
🧠 Summary
Today I learned how to:

Explore log files in /var/log

Use auditd to track process execution and file access

Simulate and detect unauthorized activity

Use ausearch and journalctl to read logs like a Blue Teamer
